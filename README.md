# Sorting Hat

## Description
This application will allow a user to sort themselves and/or others into random houses as seen in the movie Harry Potter.  Upon arrival at the site the user would then click to start sorting.  This will move the button and large image out of the way for a form to pop up.  The user then would enter in the first and last name of the person they wish to sort.  The application will then print a card showing which house they are sorted into.
## Features
